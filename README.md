## 🧩 Overview

LunaGrid-X aims to:
- Segment satellite-derived lunar imagery based on spectral data.
- Identify and classify distinct mineralogical clusters across the lunar terrain.
- Enable insights into surface composition using advanced visualization and pattern recognition techniques.

This work involves pre-processing hyperspectral data, applying unsupervised learning algorithms, and rendering surface composition maps that reflect geological variation.
